Outlander Coffee and Spices opened its doors in 1989 as a wholesale provider of coffee and spices from around the world. Today, we're one of
the largest coffee and spice wholesalers in the country. A few years ago we expanded into retail, opening three stores that quickly exeeded our expectations and sales forecasts.</p>

<p>In a recent study published in the trade publication <cite>Global Trader</cite>, analysts found that <q cite="http://outlanderspices.com/GT-article.html">U.S. spice imports hit a record high last year, the strongest year-over-year results since record-keeping began in 1966.</q> Supported by this trend, we will continue to expand in the United States in the coming months and years, starting in Boulder, Colorado and Austin, Texas. </p>
