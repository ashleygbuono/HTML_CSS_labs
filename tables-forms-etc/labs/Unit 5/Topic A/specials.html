Cinnamon is one of our most popular spices, due to its prominent role in baked goods and candies. Cinnamon is also wonderful in stews and sauces. There are two kinds of cinnamon: Ceylon and Cassia. <i>Cassia</i> cinnamon is the predominant variety because it's less expensive and stronger in flavor and aroma. <i>Ceylon</i> cinnamon is native to Sri Lanka and has a more delicate flavor than Cassia.
